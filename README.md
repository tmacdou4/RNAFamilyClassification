# RNAFamilyClassification
Classification of RNA Sequences Into Families Directly From Sequence Using Deep Learning Methods

Environment setup using conda:

    conda create -y -n RNAClassification python=3.7 scipy pandas scikit-learn pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
II - Timeline and Project Steps: 
This is a preliminary timeline and timestamps that will be used to guide us during the project. 
We are keeping in mind that some of the experiments will be conducted at the same time in parallel. 

March 30th : This document is due

Going forward:

Establishing a classification baseline using D-ORB for various non-coding RNA families ~2 days LS 

Implementation and optimization of models (in order of complexity), each requiring in-depth hyperparameter and architecture optimization. ~12 days
    DNN ~2 days LS
    RNN ~2 days TOM
    CNN ~4 days LS 
    LSTM ~4 days  TOM

Generalization Capacity Evaluation of performance of NN models + D-ORB baseline on unseen data. See Model Evaluation section for details.  Generate results figures.  ~2 days

Prepare ISMB abstract ~2 days

April 16th : ISMB Montreal 2020 Abstracts Submission date.

Prepare final project report ~12 days

Final architectural modifications / HP tests based on comparison to D-ORB ~4 days

Prepare final project report ~2 days

Prepare ISMB poster / final project powerpoint slide show presentation ~6 days

April 29th : Final Project Report and Presentation Due Date 

May 28 : Last ISMB Poster Submission deadline
